abstract = {An image-based technique for measuring the complex field in the pupil of an imaging system is presented. Two point source images, one with a small modification introduced in the pupil, are combined using a simple and non-iterative algorithm. The non-interferometric method is based on the change in the optical transfer function (OTF) giving a differential optical transfer function (dOTF). The dOTF includes two images of the complex pupil field, conjugated and reflected about the position of the pupil modification, leaving an overlap that obscures some of the pupil. The overlap can be minimized by introducing the modification near the edge of the pupil. The overlap region can be eliminated altogether by using a second modification and a third point source image. The pupil field is convolved by the change in the pupil field, so smaller modification areas are preferred. When using non-monochromatic light, the dOTF incurs a proportional radial blurring determined by the fractional bandwidth. We include some simple demonstration experiments, including using a pupil blockage and moving a single deformable mirror actuator as the pupil modification. In each case, the complex wavefront is easily recovered, even when the pupil mask is unknown and the wavefront aberrations are large.},

abstract = {Requirements for adaptive optics and compensating imaging systems lead to wave front reconstruction problems are formulated as generalized least-squares problems. For a given array of phase-difference measurements, explicit and exact solutions are constructed for the least-squares wave front error. Of particular interest are solutions with minimum norm. Two different discretizations for the gradient are used and the reasons for the different results are considered.},

@article{southwell_wavefront_1980,
abstract = {The problem of wave-front estimation from wave-front slope measurements has been examined from a least-squares curve fitting model point of view. It is shown that the slope measurement sampling geometry influences the model selection for the phase estimation. Successive over-relaxation (SOR) is employed to numerically solve the exact zonal phase estimation problem. A new zonal phase gradient model is introduced and its error propagator, which relates the mean-square wavefront error to the noisy slope measurements, has been compared with two previously used models. A technique for the rapid extraction of phase aperture functions is presented. Error propagation properties for modal estimation are evaluated and compared with zonal estimation results.},

@article{mason_minxss_2017,
abstract = {The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) is a 3 Unit (3U) CubeSat designed for a 3-month mission to study solar soft X-ray spectral irradiance. The first of the two flight models was deployed from the International Space Station in 2016 May and operated for one year before its natural deorbiting. This was the first flight of the Blue Canyon Technologies XACT 3-axis attitude determination and control system -- a commercially available, high-precision pointing system. We characterized the performance of the pointing system on orbit including performance at low altitudes where drag torque builds up. We found that the pointing accuracy was 0.0042$\backslash$degree$\backslash$ - 0.0117$\backslash$degree$\backslash$ (15{\$}''{\$} - 42{\$}''{\$}, 3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}, axis dependent) consistently from 190 km - 410 km, slightly better than the specification sheet states. Peak-to-peak jitter was estimated to be 0.0073$\backslash$degree$\backslash$ (10 s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) - 0.0183$\backslash$degree$\backslash$ (10 s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) (26{\$}''{\$} (10 s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) - 66{\$}''{\$} (10 s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}), 3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$}). The system was capable of dumping momentum until an altitude of 185 km. We found small amounts of sensor degradation in the star tracker and coarse sun sensor. Our mission profile did not require high-agility maneuvers so we are unable to characterize this metric. Without a GPS receiver, it was necessary to periodically upload ephemeris information to update the orbit propagation model and maintain pointing. At 400 km, these uploads were required once every other week. At {\$}\backslashsim{\$}270 km, they were required every day. We also characterized the power performance of our electric power system, which includes a novel pseudo-peak power tracker -- a resistor that limited the current draw from the battery on the solar panels. With 19 30$\backslash${\%} efficient solar cells and an 8 W system load, the power balance had 65$\backslash${\%} of margin on orbit. We present several recommendations to other CubeSat programs throughout.},
