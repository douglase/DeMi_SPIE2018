Measurement results of five steel samples with a roughness ranging from 0.2 to 3.125~$\mu$m demonstrate excellent correlation between the peak power and average roughness with a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.9967. The proposed adaptive-optics-assisted system is in good agreement with the stylus method, and error values of less than 8.7\% are obtained for average sample roughness in the range of 0.265 to 1.119~$\mu$m. The proposed system can be used as a rapid in-process roughness monitor/estimator to further increase the precision and stability of manufacturing processes in situ.},

  abstract = {Abstract.~
To meet the high contrast requirement of 1\texttimes{}10-10 to image an Earth-like planet around a sun-like star, space telescopes equipped with coronagraphs require wavefront control systems. Deformable mirrors (DMs) are a key element of a wavefront control system, as they correct for imperfections, thermal distortions, and diffraction that would otherwise corrupt the wavefront and ruin the contrast. The goal of the CubeSat DM technology demonstration mission is to test the ability of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) DM to perform wavefront control on-orbit on a nanosatellite platform. We consider two approaches for an MEMS DM technology demonstration payload that will fit within the mass, power, and volume constraints of a CubeSat: (1)~a Michelson interferometer and (2)~a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. We clarify the constraints on the payload based on the resources required for supporting CubeSat subsystems drawn from subsystems that we have developed for a different CubeSat flight project. We discuss results from payload laboratory prototypes and their utility in defining mission requirements.},

An exoplanet mission based on a high-altitude balloon is a next logical step in humanity's quest to explore Earthlike planets in Earthlike orbits orbiting Sunlike stars. The mission described here is capable of spectrally imaging debris disks and exozodiacal light around a number of stars spanning a range of infrared excesses, stellar types, and ages. The mission is designed to characterize the background near those stars, to study the disks themselves, and to look for planets in those systems. The background light scattered and emitted from the disk is a key uncertainty in the mission design of any exoplanet direct imaging mission, thus, its characterization is critically important for future imaging of exoplanets.},

  abstract = {For a wide range of applications in biology, medicine, and manufacturing, the small field of view associated with high-resolution microscope systems poses a significant challenge in practice. To address this limitation, a novel optical microscope uses a micromachined MEMS deformable mirror working with a specially designed scan lens to achieve a two-order-of-magnitude increase in the field of view area. Called the adaptive scanning optical microscope (ASOM), the deformable mirror in the ASOM is an integral component of the optical system and the static (glass) optical elements are specifically designed to match the shape correcting capabilities of the deformable mirror itself. After describing the design and operating principle of the ASOM, experimental results from a low-cost prototype are presented. It is shown how an image-based optimization method can be used to first calibrate the electrical voltages to the MEMS deformable mirror. And once calibrated, we show how the deformable mirror can be used in an open loop control approach for very fast operation during run time. The methods for calibration of a MEMS deformable mirror and basic control structures demonstrated form the basis for a range of emerging adaptive-optics-enabled technologies and instrumentation.},

Difficulties involved in the least-squares solution of a zonal estimation problem in which both x- and y-slope measurements are available are considered, and a successive
over-relaxation method is presented as an iterative matrix means of solving numerically the exact zonal phase estimation problem. Sources of error and error propagation in the zonal estimation reconstruction process are analyzed in terms of a new zonal phase gradient model, and the error propagator is compared to those of previously used models. The modal estimation method for phase reconstruction is then considered, and error propagation properties are compared with those of zonal
estimation. It is noted that modal estimation appears to be superior to zonal estimation in the areas of noise propagation, and computational ease.},

  abstract = {Current high-contrast "extreme" adaptive optics (ExAO) systems are partially limited by deformable mirror technology. Mirror requirements specify thousands of actuators, all of which must be functional within the clear aperture, and which give nanometer flatness yet micron stroke when operated in closed loop.1 Micro-electrical mechanical-systems (MEMS) deformable mirrors have been shown to meet ExAO actuator yield, wavefront error, and cost considerations. This study presents the performance of Boston Micromachines' 1024-actuator continuous-facesheet MEMS deformable mirrors under tests for actuator stability, position repeatability, and practical operating stroke. To explore whether MEMS actuators are susceptible to temporal variation, a series of long-term stability experiments were conducted. Each actuator was held fixed and the motion over 40 minutes was measured. The median displacement of all the actuators tested was 0.08 nm surface, inclusive of system error. MEMS devices are also appealing for adaptive optics architectures based on open-loop correction. In experiments of actuator position repeatability, 100\% of the tested actuators returned repeatedly to their starting point with a precision of $<$ 1 nm surface. Finally, MEMS devices were tested for maximum stroke achieved under application of spatially varying one-dimensional sinusoids. Given a specified amplitude in voltage, the measured stroke was 1 $\mu$m surface at the low spatial frequencies, decreasing to 0.2 $\mu$m surface for the highest spatial frequency. Stroke varied somewhat linearly as inverse spatial frequency, with a flattening in the relation at the high spatial frequency end.},

  title = {Scattering Properties of Dust in {{Orion}} and the {{Epsilon Eridani}} Exoplanetary System},
  copyright = {Copyright ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing 2013},
  abstract = {Dust grain properties were investigated in two very different Galactic environments: the interstellar medium and an exoplanetary system. Two sounding rocket missions were developed to study these regions.

Wide-field observations of the Orion OB stellar association were performed in the far-ultraviolet using the Spectrograph for Photometric Imaging with Numeric Reconstruction (SPINR) sounding rocket. These observations reveal the diffuse signature of starlight scattering off interstellar dust grains. The spectral-imaging data were used along with a three-dimensional radiative transfer model to measure the dust scattering parameters: the grain albedo ( a ) and the scattering asymmetry ( g ). The measured parameters are consistent with previous measurements made toward Orion. A sharp increase in albedo was measured at $\sim$1330 A. This feature is not explained by current grain models.

The constructed three-dimensional model of Orion includes a two-component dust distribution. The foreground distribution is responsible for the small amount of visible reddening measured toward the bright stars in the Orion constellation. The background distribution represents the Orion Molecular Cloud, which dominates observations of dust emission in the infrared. This model was used to show that backscattered light from the molecular cloud alone cannot produce the observed scattered light distribution. The foreground dust, though optically thin in the visible, significantly contributes to the scattered light in the far-ultraviolet. This suggests that observations of Orion in the infrared and far-ultraviolet may probe entirely different dust populations.

The Planetary Imaging Concept Testbed Using a Rocket Experiment (PICTURE) sounding rocket was developed to characterize dust grains in the nearby Epsilon Eridani exoplanetary system. This is a young, dusty system with a Jupiter-massed planet orbiting at $\sim$3.4 AU (astronomical units). PICTURE sought to capture a direct, visible-light image of dust-scattered starlight in this system with the aid of a high-contrast nulling coronagraph. The design and laboratory testing of the PICTURE science payload is presented. Although the mission returned no science data, several important technological advances were made to enable future direct imaging missions. Most notably, PICTURE demonstrated 5.1 milliarcsecond pointing stability using a fast optical tracking system.},

  abstract = {The need for high-dynamic-range imaging is crucial in many astronomical fields, such as extra-solar planet direct detection, extragalactic science, and circumstellar imaging. Using a high-quality coronograph, dynamic ranges of up to 10$^{5}$ have been achieved. However the ultimate limitations of coronographs do not come from their optical performances, but from scattering due to imperfections in the optical surfaces of the collecting system. We propose the use of a deformable mirror to correct these imperfections and decrease the scattering level in local regions called "dark holes." Using this technique will enable imaging of fields with dynamic ranges exceeding 10\textphi. We show that the dark-hole algorithm results in a lower scattering level than simply minimizing the rms figure error (maximum-strehl-ratio algorithm). The achievable scattering level inside the dark-hole region will depend on the number of mirror actuators, the surface quality of the telescope, the single-actuator influence function, and the observing wavelength. We have simulated cases with a 37\texttimes{}37 deformable mirror using data from the Hubble Space Telescope optics without spherical aberrations and have demonstrated dark holes with rectangular and annular shapes. We also present a preliminary concept of a monolithic, fully integrated, high-density deformable mirror which can be used for this type of space application.},

Deformable mirrors (DMs) are a key element of a wavefront control system, as they correct for imperfections, thermal distortions, and diffraction that would otherwise corrupt the wavefront and ruin the contrast. The goal of the CubeSat Deformable Mirror technology demonstration mission is to test the ability of a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) deformable mirror to perform wavefront control on-orbit on a nanosatellite platform. In this paper, we consider two approaches for a MEMS deformable mirror technology demonstration payload that will fit within the mass, power, and volume constraints of a CubeSat: 1) a Michelson interferometer and 2) a Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensor. We clarify the constraints on the payload based on the resources required for supporting CubeSat subsystems drawn from subsystems that we have developed for a different CubeSat flight project. We discuss results from payload lab prototypes and their utility in defining mission requirements.},

  abstract = {UK MoD has long been an advocate of the use of mathematically formal verification in software for safety critical applications. In the past this has been focused on the SPARK Ada subset, but it is increasingly becoming difficult to find suppliers willing or capable of delivering Ada programs. Instead, there is a pressure to use more commercially attractive languages, such as C and C++. In order to maintain the high levels of confidence necessary for critical applications, this means being able to formally reason about these `new' languages. This paper covers two related programmes that are developing formal semantics for restricted subsets of C and C++ respectively. It will also consider how the formal semantics will be exploited in a verification environment.},

  abstract = {In numerical linear algebra, the method of successive over-relaxation (SOR) is a variant of the Gauss\textendash{}Seidel method for solving a linear system of equations, resulting in faster convergence. A similar method can be used for any slowly converging iterative process.
It was devised simultaneously by David M. Young, Jr. and by Stanley P. Frankel in 1950 for the purpose of automatically solving linear systems on digital computers. Over-relaxation methods had been used before the work of Young and Frankel. An example is the method of Lewis Fry Richardson, and the methods developed by R. V. Southwell. However, these methods were designed for computation by human calculators, and they required some expertise to ensure convergence to the solution which made them inapplicable for programming on digital computers. These aspects are discussed in the thesis of David M. Young, Jr.},

However, when the grid patterns are nonrectangular, modal wavefront reconstruction has been extensively used. We propose an improved zonal wavefront reconstruction algorithm for Hartmann type test with arbitrary grid patterns. We develop the mathematical expressions to show that the wavefront over arbitrary grid patterns, such as misaligned, partly obscured, and non-square mesh grids, can be estimated well. Both iterative solution and least-square solution for the proposed algorithm are described and compared. Numerical calculation shows that the zonal wavefront reconstruction over nonrectangular profile with the proposed algorithm results in a significant improvement in comparison with the Southwell algorithm.},

Soldering using metallic solder alloys is an alternative to adhesive bonding. Laser-based soldering processes are especially well suited for the joining of optical components made of fragile and brittle materials such as glass, ceramics, and optical crystals. This is due to a localized and minimized input of thermal energy. Solderjet bumping technology has been used to assemble a lens mount breadboard using specifications and requirements found for the optical beam expander for the European Space Agency EarthCare Mission. The silica lens and a titanium barrel have been designed and assembled with this technology in order to withstand the stringent mission demands of handling high mechanical and thermal loads without losing the optical performance. Finally, a high-precision optomechanical lens mount has been assembled with minimal localized stress ($<$1\,\,MPa) showing outstanding performance in terms of wave-front error and beam depolarization ratio before and after environmental tests.},

This technology is critical to enable coronagraphic direct imaging of exoplanets utilized in ground-based telescopes and future space missions such as WFIRST, EXO-C, HabEx, and LUVOIR. We have developed a miniaturized Deformable Mirror controller to enable active optics on small space imaging mission. The system is based on the Boston Micromachines Corporation Kilo-DM, which is one of the most widespread DMs on the market. The system has three main components: The Deformable Mirror, the Driving Electronics, and the Mechanical and Heat management. The system is designed to be extremely compact and have lowpower consumption to enable its use not only on exoplanet missions, but also in a wide-range of applications that require precision optical systems, such as direct line-of-sight laser communications, and guidance systems. The controller is capable of handling 1,024 actuators with 220V maximum dynamic range, 16bit resolution, and 14bit accuracy, and operating at up to 1kHz frequency. The system fits in a 10x10x5cm volume, weighs less than 0.5kg, and consumes less than 8W. We have developed a turnkey solution reducing the risk for currently planned as well as future missions, lowering their cost by significantly reducing volume, weight and power consumption of the wavefront control hardware.},

Rigorous analysis shows how slope estimation performance depends precisely on scene content and illumination. Scaling laws for changes in illumination are derived.

  abstract = {This survey is a general overview of modern optical studies of the Moon and their diagnostic meaning. It includes three united parts: phase photometry, spectrophotometry, and polarimetry. The first one is devoted to the progress in the photometry of the Moon, which includes absolute albedo determination to refine the albedo scale (e.g., to connect lunar observations and the data of lunar sample measurements) and mapping the parameters of a lunar photometric function (e.g., the phase-angle ratios method) with the aim of making qualitative estimates of regolith structure variations. This part also includes observations of the lunar opposition effect as well as photogrammetry and photoclinometry techniques. In particular, available data show that because of the low albedo of the lunar surface, the coherent backscattering enhancement hardly influences the lunar opposition spike, with the exception of the brightest lunar areas measured in the NIR. The second part is devoted to chemical/mineral mapping of the Moon's surface using spectrophotometric measurements. This section also includes analyses related to the detection of water ice or hydroxyl, prognoses of maturity, and helium-3 abundance mapping. In particular, we examine the relationship between superficial OH/H2O compounds spectrally detected recently and bulk ``water ice'' found earlier by the Lunar Prospector GRS and LRO LEND, assuming that the compounds are delivered to cold traps (permanently shadowed regions) with electrostatically levitated dust saturated by solar wind hydrogen. Significant problems arise with the determination of TiO2 content, as the correlation between this parameter and the color ratio C(750/415 nm) is very non-linear and not universal for different composition types of the lunar surface; a promising way to resolve this problem is to use color ratios in the UV spectral range. The third part is devoted to mapping of polarization parameters of the lunar surface, which enable estimates of the average size of regolith particles and their optical inhomogeneity. This includes considerations of the Umov effect and results of spectropolarimetry, negative polarization imagery, and measurements of other polarimetric parameters, including the third Stokes parameter. Although these three research divisions have not been developed equally and the numbers of proper references are very different, we try to keep a balance between them, depicting a uniform picture. It should be emphasized that many results presented in this review can be applied to other atmosphereless celestial bodies as well.},

  abstract = {Mission Overview

Exo-C is a mission concept study chartered in 2013 by NASA HQ. It is an agile space observatory optimally designed for direct imaging and spectroscopy of nearby planetary systems using internal coronagraphs, instruments that are close to technical readiness after a decade of laboratory work. Over its 3 year mission Exo-C will detect and characterize planets in reflected starlight, from Jupiter to super-Earth sizes and located in Saturn- like to Earth-like orbits. It will study cool planets like those in our solar system\textemdash{}complementing transit studies of hot, short-period planets\textemdash{}and serve as a technology pathfinder for future imaging of Earth-like planets.

Mission Design
Exo-C brings together a 1.4-m aperture, precision pointing and wavefront control, internal coronagraphs, and a highly stable observatory to enable optical wavelength (0.45\textendash{}1.0 m) studies of nearby planetary systems at billion-to-one contrast. Its high contrast imaging performance will surpass that of the Hubble Space Telescope by a factor of 1000 and that of any other ground or space telescope now operating or under construction. The mission and hardware design are patterned after the highly successful Kepler mission, to achieve the same goal of delivering ground-breaking exoplanet science at an affordable cost.

 Science Objectives
\textbullet{} Discovery of new planets in the Solar neighborhood: Exo-C's multi-epoch imaging will search beyond the limits of other detection techniques around $>$100 nearby stars including alpha Centauri. Small mini-Neptune, super-Earth, and possibly Earth-sized planets will be detectable.
\textbullet{} Characterization of known and mission-discovered planets: Exo-C will measure the colors and spectra of at least a dozen known radial velocity planets orbiting nearby stars, and of the bright- est new planets it discovers - measuring primary atmospheric constituents such as CH4 and H2O.
\textbullet{} Structure and evolution of circumstellar disks: Exo-C will resolve the structure of dust clouds orbiting nearby stars, tracing the gravitational effect of planets too small and remote to detect by any other means, in a sample of hundreds of exo-Kuiper belts
\textbullet{} Survey of dust in habitable zones: Exo-C's inner working angle of 0.16'' at 550 nm will spatially resolve the habitable zones of up to 150 nearby stars},

  abstract = {The raw coronagraphic performance of current high-contrast imaging instruments is limited by the presence of a quasi-static speckle (QSS) background, resulting from instrumental non-common path errors (NCPEs). Rapid development of efficient speckle subtraction techniques in data reduction has enabled final contrasts of up to 10-6 to be obtained, however it remains preferable to eliminate the underlying NCPEs at the source. In this work we introduce the coronagraphic Modal Wavefront Sensor (cMWS), a new wavefront sensor suitable for real-time NCPE correction. This pupil-plane optic combines the apodizing phase plate coronagraph with a holographic modal wavefront sensor, to provide simultaneous coronagraphic imaging and focal-plane wavefront sensing using the science point spread function. We first characterise the baseline performance of the cMWS via idealised closed-loop simulations, showing that the sensor successfully recovers diffraction-limited coronagraph performance over an effective dynamic range of +/-2.5 radians root-mean-square (RMS) wavefront error within 2-10 iterations. We then present the results of initial on-sky testing at the William Herschel Telescope, and demonstrate that the sensor is able to retrieve injected wavefront aberrations to an accuracy of 10nm RMS under realistic seeing conditions. We also find that the cMWS is capable of real-time broadband measurement of atmospheric wavefront variance at a cadence of 50Hz across an uncorrected telescope sub-aperture. When combined with a suitable closed-loop adaptive optics system, the cMWS holds the potential to deliver an improvement in raw contrast of up to two orders of magnitude over the uncorrected QSS floor. Such a sensor would be eminently suitable for the direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets with both existing and future instruments, including EPICS and METIS for the E-ELT.},

The effects were seen with microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) resonators employing reflowed glass and/or direct silicon bonded sealing interfaces. Resonator Q , peak gain and frequency all indicate the degradation of vacuum quality due to low temperature ingress of helium into the sealed vacuum chamber. These effects were seen between 23 and 100 $^\circ$C after and during helium exposure at relatively low pressures of 140 to 380 kPa. Similar effects were not observed for hydrogen, argon and air. The results may suggest diffusion of helium through silicon at low temperatures and have implications for hermeticity testing using MIL-STD 883E, applications for the exposure of a wide variety of MEMS devices to helium and possibly wafer processing using helium.},

  abstract = {Design, modeling, fabrication, and testing of a new type of optical communication node enabled by micromachined mirror is described. The micromirror device is capable of switching within 1$\mu$s between two states \textemdash{} one planar and reflective in the substrate surface normal direction and one corrugated and diffractive. It is used as one facet in a corner-cube retroreflector that can communicate by returning a temporally modulated beam to an interrogating laser transceiver. Design of a very low-cost device suitable for use as a communication node at ranges of several hundred meters is detailed. In particular, fabrication approaches are described for the micromirror that minimize the number of layers and process steps while employing scalable, high-volume thin film manufacturing. Ultimately, a process comprised of three thin film depositions, on lithographic patterning step, and one timed etch produces a robust and easily mass produced device. The devices that were tested featured up to 10:1 modulation of an incident beam in some configurations, and allow robust, secure optical switching through free space. Processes for combining the modulator with two orthogonal facets to comprise a retroreflector are described, and adequate orthogonality is demonstrated for communication over the intended range. Intrinsic stress behavior of tensile thin films are exploited to achieve nanometer scale flatness in the unactuated device, and a compact electronics driver is used to encode data and frequency modulate the active device. Electromechanical models that predict device behavior during electrostatic actuation are detailed. A functional prototype communication system using the modulated retroreflector and a telescope containing a 1.5$\mu$m wavelength laser and photodetector decoder is described, and secure communication is demonstrated over a free space path.},

  title = {Improving Nanosatellite Capabilities for Atmospheric Sounding and Characterization},
  copyright = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7582},
  abstract = {Measurements of atmospheric temperature, pressure, water vapor, and composition are important to users in the Earth science, defense, and intelligence communities. Nanosatellites (with mass $<$ 10 kg, such as CubeSats) can support miniaturized instruments for atmospheric sounding and characterization. Nanosatellite constellations can improve spatial and temporal coverage of Earth and can produce data consistent with the current state of the art at reduced cost compared with larger satellites. Nanosatellites are also used for on-orbit technology demonstrations due to low cost and higher risk posture. We focus on CubeSats as a host platform for instruments and technology demonstrations for three kinds of atmospheric sensors: (i) passive microwave radiometers, (ii) atmospheric occultation experiments and (iii) coronagraphic direct imaging of exoplanets. Microwave radiometers (MWR) measure brightness temperatures in multiple channels across bands centered on atmospheric absorption features. MWRs require stable cold and warm calibration targets for accurate measurements. CubeSat MWRs, such as MicroMAS (the Micro-sized Microwave Atmospheric Satellite) and MiRaTA (Microwave Radiometer Technology Acceleration), use deep space as a cold target with a noise diode as the warm target instead of larger calibration targets. However, noise diodes drift, and a better calibration method is needed to meet the desired measurement precision. Occultation experiments measure electromagnetic signals received from a transmitter as it passes behind the Earth from the perspective of the receiver. In the neutral atmosphere, the measurements yield profiles of temperature, pressure and in certain configurations, composition. We consider radio and optical wavelengths. GPS Radio Occultation (GPSRO) instruments measure phase delay in signals transmitted from GPS satellites that travel through the atmosphere to a low earth orbit (LEO) receiver. GPSRO measurements are inherently well calibrated, because the primary interaction is of an electromagnetic wave through a medium, and have high accuracy and vertical resolution. We show that it is possible to make several GPSRO measurements per day that are collocated spatially and temporally with space-based MWR measurements and that using these measurements enables better MWR calibration by measuring noise diode drift. Occultation observations using several near infrared optical wavelengths can measure absorption features to characterize atmospheric species and abundances. Intersatellite optical links are used for these measurements, but transmissions deep in the atmosphere experience scintillation and distortion. Wavefront control systems could be used to compensate for atmosphere-induced aberrations. Wavefront control systems are also needed to obtain reflection absorption spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, where photons from the host star are reflected by the planet. A space-based telescope equipped with an internal coronagraph can make high contrast measurements off-axis using high spatial frequency wavefront control systems to correct for speckles, imperfections, and other distortions that would degrade the measurement. High actuator count deformable mirrors (DMs) are needed, and Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) DMs can provide a cost-effective, compact solution. We describe our design for a nanosatellite platform using a wavefront sensor to characterize the on-orbit performance of MEMS DMs. We present results from these new approaches to improve atmospheric sounding and characterization missions using nanosatellites. Our hardware analysis for MiRaTA demonstrates that the CubeSat GPSRO instrument noise performance supports the calibration of the noise diode to improve the CubeSat MWR measurement accuracy from $>$ 0.75 K to 0.25 K. We simulate and experimentally demonstrate a CubeSat wavefront control system using a MEMS DM that can be used to characterize the performance of MEMS DMs, sensitive to 10's of nm motion and up to three times the 1.5 pm-stroke of the DMs, which is useful for future applications in both atmospheric near infrared occultation as well as in exoplanet direct imaging space telescopes. Each of these contributions improves current nanosatellite capabilities or uses nanosatellites to advance technologies in future larger systems for atmospheric sounding and characterization of Earth and exoplanets.},

in 2016 of large candidate astrophysics missions for consideration by
the 2020 Decadal Survey. The studies are expected to include two mission
concepts capable of directly imaging exo-earths (HabEx and LUVOIR).
Direct imaging of an exo-earth begins with starlight suppression, which
is required at a depth of 10-10 in the visible for an
earth-sun twin. The current results of laboratory coronagraphs are
approaching the levels needed for the direct detection and
characterization of an exo-earth. Other critical technologies are
needed, such as ultra-low noise detectors, large format deformable
mirrors, a large aperture space telescope, and sophisticated
post-processing algorithms. While technologically challenging, the goal
is not impossible; many of the required technologies are already at TRL
3 and beyond. After the successful on-orbit operation of WFIRST-AFTA in
the next decade, some of the technologies will be at TRL 9. This paper
summarizes the needed technologies that NASA's Exoplanet Exploration
Program is prioritizing for maturation.},

  abstract = {We have recently carried out spectral synthesis modeling to determine T eff , log g , v sin i , and [Fe/H] for 1040 FGK-type stars on the Keck, Lick, and Anglo-Australian Telescope planet search programs. This is the first time that a single, uniform spectroscopic analysis has been made for every star on a large Doppler planet search survey. We identify a subset of 850 stars that have Doppler observations sufficient to detect uniformly all planets with radial velocity semiamplitudes K $>$ 30 m s -1 and orbital periods shorter than 4 yr. From this subset of stars, we determine that fewer than 3\% of stars with -0.5 $<$ [Fe/H] $<$ 0.0 have Doppler-detected planets. Above solar metallicity, there is a smooth and rapid rise in the fraction of stars with planets. At [Fe/H] $>$ +0.3 dex, 25\% of observed stars have detected gas giant planets. A power-law fit to these data relates the formation probability for gas giant planets to the square of the number of metal atoms. High stellar metallicity also appears to be correlated with the presence of multiple-planet systems and with the total detected planet mass. This data set was examined to better understand the origin of high metallicity in stars with planets. None of the expected fossil signatures of accretion are observed in stars with planets relative to the general sample: (1) metallicity does not appear to increase as the mass of the convective envelopes decreases, (2) subgiants with planets do not show dilution of metallicity, (3) no abundance variations for Na, Si, Ti, or Ni are found as a function of condensation temperature, and (4) no correlations between metallicity and orbital period or eccentricity could be identified. We conclude that stars with extrasolar planets do not have an accretion signature that distinguishes them from other stars; more likely, they are simply born in higher metallicity molecular clouds.},

corresponding to stars brighter than \textasciitilde{}0.5 solar luminosities (late G-/early K-type dwarf stars at the 30 pc distance limit). For each star we provide astrometry (including Equatorial and Galactic coordinates, parallax, and proper motions), Johnson B and V magnitudes (converted from Hipparcos or Tycho data or taken from the literature), and Ks-band magnitudes from 2MASS (for fainter stars) or K-band magnitudes taken from the literature and converted to 2MASS Ks magnitudes (for bright stars). Using these data we estimate stellar luminosity, effective temperature, stellar radius (in solar and angular units),
Earth-equivalent insolation distances (in AU and in angular units), and fraction planet brightness for an exo=Earth at the Earth-equivalent insolation distance. We provide published spectral types and simple labels on stellar type for quick assessment of design reference
mission-selected targets lists. The number of known exoplanet companions is indicated for each star, and for bright stars (V$<$7) we provide separations and delta-magnitudes for the brightest stellar companion within 10 arcseconds. Other important stellar data such as log(g), chromospheric activity level, and age estimates are provided where readily available. ExoCat-1 can be found through the Exoplanets

  abstract = {In preparation for the Astro 2020 Decadal Survey NASA has commissioned the study four flagship missions spanning to a wide range of observable wavelengths: the Origins Space Telescope (OST, formerly the Far-Infrared Surveyor), Lynx (formerly the X-ray Surveyor), the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) and the Habitable Exoplanet Imager (HabEx). One of the key scientific objectives of the latter two is the detection and characterization of the earth-like planets around nearby stars using the direct imaging technique (along with a broad range of investigations regarding the architecture of and atmospheric composition exoplanetary systems using this technique). As a consequence dedicated exoplanet instruments are being studied for these mission concepts. This paper discusses the design of the coronagraph instrument for the architecture ``A'' (15 meters aperture) of LUVOIR. The material presented in this paper is aimed at providing an overview of the LUVOIR coronagraph instrument. It is the result of four months of discussions with various community stakeholders (scientists and technologists) regarding the instrument's basic parameters followed by meticulous design work by the the GSFC Instrument Design Laboratory team. In the first section we review the main science drivers, presents the overall parameters of the instrument (general architecture and backend instrument) and delve into the details of the currently envisioned coronagraph masks along with a description of the wavefront control architecture. Throughout the manuscript we describe the trades we made during the design process. Because the vocation of this study is to provide a baseline design for the most ambitious earth-like finding instrument that could be possibly launched into the 2030's, we have designed an complex system privileged that meets the ambitious science goals out team was chartered by the LUVOIR STDT exoplanet Working Group. However in an effort to minimize technological risk we tried to maximize the number of technologies that will be matured by the WFIRST coronagraph instruments.},

  abstract = {The Deformable Mirror Demonstration Mission (DeMi) was recently selected by DARPA to demonstrate in-space operation of a wavefront sensor and Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) deformable mirror (DM) payload on a 6U CubeSat. Space telescopes designed to make high-contrast observations using internal coronagraphs for direct characterization of exoplanets require the use of high-actuator density deformable mirrors. These DMs can correct image plane aberrations and speckles caused by imperfections, thermal distortions, and diffraction in the telescope and optics that would otherwise corrupt the wavefront and allow leaking starlight to contaminate coronagraphic images. DeMi is provide on-orbit demonstration and performance characterization of a MEMS deformable mirror and closed loop wavefront sensing. The DeMi payload has two operational modes, one mode that images an internal light source and another mode which uses an external aperture to images stars. Both the internal and external modes include image plane and pupil plane wavefront sensing. The objectives of the internal measurement of the 140-actuator MEMS DM actuator displacement are characterization of the mirror performance and demonstration of closed-loop correction of aberrations in the optical path. Using the external aperture to observe stars of magnitude 2 or brighter, assuming 3-axis stability with less than 0.1 degree of attitude knowledge and jitter below 10 arcsec RMSE, per observation, DeMi will also demonstrate closed loop wavefront control on an astrophysical target. We present an updated payload design, results from simulations and laboratory optical prototyping, as well as present our design for accommodating high-voltage multichannel drive electronics for the DM on a CubeSat.},

  abstract = {We report on a family of complex birefringent elements, called Multi-Twist Retarders (MTRs), which offer remarkably effective control of broadband polarization transformation. MTRs consist of two or more twisted liquid crystal (LC) layers on a single substrate and with a single alignment layer. Importantly, subsequent LC layers are aligned directly by prior layers, allowing simple fabrication, achieving automatic layer registration, and resulting in a monolithic film with a continuously varying optic axis. In this work, we employ a numerical design method and focus on achromatic quarter- and half-wave MTRs. In just two or three layers, these have bandwidths and general behavior that matches or exceeds all traditional approaches using multiple homogenous retarders. We validate the concept by fabricating several quarter-wave retarders using a commercial polymerizeable LC, and show excellent achromaticity across bandwidths of 450\textendash{}650 nm and 400\textendash{}800 nm. Due to their simple fabrication and many degrees of freedom, MTRs are especially well suited for patterned achromatic retarders, and can easily achieve large bandwidth and/or low-variation of retardation within visible through infrared wavelengths.},
